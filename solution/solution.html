<p>The challenge informs the user to SSH into a server affected by a kernel-space keylogger. They are also informed that some debugging features appear to be left in. This should prompt the player to view kernel messages with <code>dmesg</code>.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">dmesg output</p>
</div>
<p>Here, the output shows the file <code>/var/logs/keys</code> is being written to. Investigating this shows it contains the keylogger output. The next challenge is to work out which process is interacting with this file. This can be achieved with <code>fstat</code> or <code>lsof</code>.</p>

<p>This shows the process 'keys' is being run by root and is interacting with the keylogger output file. This is a user-space process, however, and the debug message was in the kernel messages. This implies the process is interacting with the kernel in some way. This should lead the player to want to investigate the process with <code>strace</code>, however this command is not available in FreeBSD. Instead, the player must research and learn about <code>truss</code>, <code>ktrace</code> and <code>kdump</code>. Using the former, we can see a syscall is made to 'modfind' and then 'modstat' in order to locate an unknown syscall called 'sys/logging'. An unknown syscall is then called immediately after, presumably the one that had been found.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">truss output</p>
</div>
<p>The player will then need to interact with this syscall. However, they first need the syscall offset number. To do this, they could either write a C program that uses 'modfind' to retrieve this by the syscall name, or use a tool to do it. <code>truss</code> does not provide this, but <code>kdump</code> does. This first requires use of <code>ktrace</code>, however attaching <code>ktrace</code> directly to the process causes it to exit immediately without giving any output. To solve this, the player must put it in an infinite loop and use the 'append' mode of <code>trace</code>, then wait a minute for the 'keys' process to make the syscall again.</p>

<img src="imgs/03-ktrace.png" alt="waiting with ktrace" />
<p class="caption">waiting with ktrace</p>
</div>
<p>Once the syscall is captured, the player can use the <code>-S</code> option of <code>kdump</code> to obtain the offset number.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="imgs/04-kdump.png" alt="kdump output" />
<p class="caption">kdump output</p>
</div>
<p>With this, the user can now interact with syscall. Some simple analysis of the arguments shows that it takes two addresses - likely string pointers - and an integer (512). The user will want to interact with the syscall and try out different combinations of these arguments. This can be done with a scripting language such as <code>perl</code>. The user's first instinct may be to try using three zeros as arguments. This seemingly gives no output, however investigating <code>dmesg</code> once more shows it did, showing the player they are on the right track.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="imgs/06-syscall1.png" alt="dmesg output" />
<p class="caption">dmesg output</p>
</div>
<p>While the syscall is able to handle an address of zero to print, it will still crash when given a different address to try and dereference. For example:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="imgs/07-syscall2.png" alt="crash" />
<p class="caption">crash</p>
</div>
<p>This crashes the kernel. The system will reboot and create a crash dump. Once the operating system is back, the player can SSH back in. They now need to use a kernel debugger to inspect the crash dump. Instructions on how to do this are hiding in plain sight, in the FreeBSD Developer's Handbook, which is linked in the motd.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="imgs/00-motd.png" alt="motd" />
<p class="caption">motd</p>
</div>
<p>The documentation there explains how to use <code>kgdb</code>. This process can be repeated by the player to inspect the crash dump.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="imgs/08-kgdb1.png" alt="running kgdb" />
<p class="caption">running kgdb</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, the player can inspect the crash dump and see the obviously named 'rootkit.c'. Moving up the stack trace will allow player to inspect this file, and using gdb to print the file will reveal the key.</p>
